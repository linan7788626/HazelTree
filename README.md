# HazelTree

Simulation and analysis of networked crowd-sourced online citizen science modeling. 

Web-based citizen science projects such as those hosted by the [Zooniverse](http://zooniverse.org) have great potential for enabling large numbers of people to take part in scientific data analysis. We can imagine a variety of ways in which these *citizen modelers* might learn the skills they need for a particular project, including both online tutorials and in-person instruction. `HazelTree` is open source code for modeling such a network of modelers and their instructors, and analyzing the data (ie. inferred model parameters) that is output by modeling tools such as [`Hoopla`](https://github.com/linan7788626/Hoopla).
